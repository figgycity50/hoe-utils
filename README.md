Farming utilities. Each command does what the name says. Also use farmbuild to harvest.

1. Put the turtle at the bottom left corner 1 block above the ground, 1 block behind the farm's location facing the farm.
2. Download hoe-utils.
3. Type farmbuild <square farm size>.
4. Don't get in the way while it makes the farm or it screws up.
5. Put seeds in the currently selected slot.
6. Type farmplant <square farm size> to plant seeds.
7. Repeat step 4, replacing makes to plants.
8. Either wait the crops to grow or put bonemeal in the currently selected slot.
9. If you put bonemeal, type farmgrow <square farm size> to bonemeal your crops. You may need to refill the bonemeal a few times.
10. Type farmbuild <square farm size> to harvest the farm.
11. TADA! Your turtle can now manage your farm. To regrow, restart from step 5.
